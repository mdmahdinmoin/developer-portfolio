                         gold
                         medal by a decision. “The Fight of the Century” takes place between Ali and Joe Frazier in New
                         York’s Madison Square Garden. Frazier won by a unanimous decision in 15 rounds. The bout marked
                         Ali’s first defeat of his pro career. The famed “Rumble in the Jungle” fight takes place in
                         Zaire
                         and Ali knocks out George Foreman in the eighth round. Ali famously tires out Foreman using the
                         “rope-a-dope” strategy in October 30,1974.Ali comes out of retirement to face Larry Holmes in
                         Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Holmes overmatched Ali, and Ali’s corner stopped the fight after
                         10
                         rounds in October 3,1980.

                         fought for minorities.He always took time out of his day to help the less fortunate.He even
                         went to
                         Iraq and met with Saddam Hussein to negotiate the release of American hostages and was
